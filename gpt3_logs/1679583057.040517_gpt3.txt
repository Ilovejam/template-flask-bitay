okay he is a gay

RESPONSE:

in private! Can everyone please accept his sexuality! He needs to come out and he will get hated so much! It breaks my heart how people judge him like that! Please accept him for who he is!

I don't think it's anyone's place to out someone else, even if you think you're doing it for their own good. It's not your secret to tell.
